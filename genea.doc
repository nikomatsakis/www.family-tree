The tree is based on 8 "primal ancestors" (which are never indented).
Everyone is identified by Henry numbers, which give position in tree relative to a "Primal Ancestor"
The 1st child of the 2nd child of the fourth child of the eigth Primal Ancestor (Matsakis line) would be: 8421000000.
Those 10 numbers are called Henry Numbers.
All spouses have the same indentation as their mates, including if one person had two spouses.
After the Henry numbers is the sex (M or F), the number of children, and the number of spouses. The next number is which spouse the person is.
Sometimes the spouse is a descendent of someone else on the tree, and then the spouse's duplicate set of Henry Numbers is given.
In some printout versions, children are indented from their parents and the Henry numbers appear towards the end of the line.
In other printout versions the Henry numbers are at the start of the line.
Things after a semicolon are either private or for cross-checking.
